# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm thinking about creating some sort of expense tracker to help me budget. I would want it to either receive direct input about where I spent the money and how much (like a Google form that goes to an Excel sheet that is then read), or be able to read bank statements / credit card statements (I would not want to do this if it's not secure). Then it can help me analyze how I spend my money. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to do this project by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any questions at the moment.
