Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

As of 4/21, I have figured out how to download the CSV transaction files from my bank and credit card and have them read through pandas. Then, it removes the transfers between my accounts and re-categorizes the expenses so they match each other and are in correct categories. This took significantly longer than I had anticipated. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to figure out how to merge my transactions from all of my csv files into one that will let me see my monthly spending. I had originally planned to have a dashboard that graphs my expenses, but I don't think I want to do that anymore. My current thought is to write a new csv file that has all of the month to month information totaled for each category (I would be able to create graphs in Excel later if I wanted the information presented that way). I also would like to include my cashback rewards for my credit card, but I'm not sure the best way to go about that.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I struggled to figure out how to even get my transaction data from all of my accounts and then figuring out how to recategorize the different transactions. I also struggled getting jupyter_dash to not cause an error, so I think I will eliminate the idea of a dashboard and instead just write a new csv file that contains everything that I want to track.
